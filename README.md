## Installation
Step-by-step guide to get a copy of the project up and running locally for development and testing.

### Prerequisites
Which things you need to install the softwre and how to install them,

```bash
$ install required software and libraries
```

### Install
A step-by-step guide to installing the project, including necessary configuration etc.

```bash
$ git clone <GitHub repo>
$ cd <project>
$ npm install
$ dfx start --background
$ dfx deploy
```

Nullam eu dictum ipsum, eu sagittis lacus. Integer posuere purus vel nisi sodales posuere. Donec dolor libero, posuere ac lacinia vitae, ornare a nisl. Praesent placerat quam non elit blandit, ut pretium lacus rutrum.

## Usage
Most projects have a frontend, so link to the canister and provide a brief getting-started instruction. If the project has a backend that may be called without a frontend, which is typically the case for developer libraries, tooling, infrastructure etc., then provide some basic examples of how to use it.

### Run Front-End
```bash
$ npm run dev
```

### Example 1
Usage examples can be canister calls:

```bash
$ dfx canister call mycanister myfunc '("abc")'
```

### Example 2
If the project is added as a separate canister, show how to access the functions.

```javascript
import MyFunc  "mo:myproj/MyFunc";  

private let myFunc = MyFunc.MyFunc();

...

let value = myFunc("abc");

...
```

## Documentation
Further documentation can exist in the README file if the project only contains a few functions. It can also be located elsewhere, if it is extensive, if this is the case, link to it.

## Testing
Test instructions, and test scripts, for this project:

```bash
$ run test
```

Test specific feature:

```bash
$ run test 1
```

## Roadmap
Describe the project roadmap, this could be the grant milestones, but it could also be the team's broader project roadmap.
